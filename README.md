## Development

### Running

To start, install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

From here, you can build the code with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will watch for changes in the code and rebuild as necessary. The build goes to `/dist`.

Then you can run either Storybook or one of the examples (within another terminal):

#### Storybook

```bash
npm run storybook
```

#### Examples

First `cd` into the example folder you want to run, then install dependencies with:

```bash
npm i
```

Then you can run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the example and will live reload as changes are made to the source or example code.

### Building

If you need to create a one-off build, you can use:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Validation

To run tests and validate changes to code, run:

```bash
npm run validate
```
